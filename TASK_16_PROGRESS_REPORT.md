### ‚ö†Ô∏è Module 4: Order Processing Saga (IN PROGRESS - BLOCKED)

**File:** `src/modules/orders/services/order-processing-saga.service.spec.ts`

**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKED - Tests timing out

**Current Coverage:** 78.67%  
**Target Coverage:** 95%  
**Tests Added:** 14 new tests  
**Tests Passing:** 14/16 (2 tests timeout)

**Tests Implemented:**

- ‚úÖ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ Notification failures (non-critical, saga continues)
- ‚úÖ Saga not found error
- ‚úÖ Compensation actions (REFUND_PAYMENT, NOTIFY_FAILURE)
- ‚úÖ Compensation failure handling
- ‚úÖ Non-retryable errors
- ‚úÖ Multiple product items
- ‚ùå Database errors (timeout issue)
- ‚ùå Circuit breaker states (timeout issue)

**Issue:**

- 2 tests are causing timeouts (>5 seconds)
- Tests hung at: `npm test -- src/modules/orders/services/order-processing-saga.service.spec.ts`
- Likely issue: Complex saga retry logic with sleep() delays

**Recommendation:**

- Skip problematic tests or refactor with shorter delays
- Current coverage (78.67%) is still good, but below 95% target
- Can revisit tomorrow with fresh approach

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)

### High Priority

1. **Fix Order Saga timeout issues** (2 tests)
   - Refactor tests to use shorter delays
   - Or skip problematic tests temporarily
   - Current: 78.67% ‚Üí Target: 95%

2. **Queue Processors** (33.9% ‚Üí 90%)
   - inventory.processor.ts: 0%
   - notification.processor.ts: 0%
   - payment.processor.ts: 0%
   - order-processing.processor.ts: 63.63%
   - **High impact:** ~3-5% global coverage increase

3. **Categories Module** (15.54% ‚Üí 85%)
   - Very low coverage, needs attention
   - Complex hierarchical logic to test

### Medium Priority

4. **Products Service** (76.92% ‚Üí 85%)
   - Already has good baseline
   - Incremental improvement needed

5. **Validate all quality gates:**
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Run `npm run format`
   - Run `npm audit`

---

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Action

1. ‚úÖ **Commit current progress** (3 modules completed)
2. ‚úÖ **Push to remote**
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Pause Order Saga work** (2 timeout tests need debugging)
4. üìã **Document blockers clearly**

### For Tomorrow

1. üîß **Debug Saga timeout issues** with shorter delays
2. üéØ **Focus on Queue Processors** (highest ROI)
3. üìä **Aim for 70-75% coverage** (realistic adjusted target)
4. ‚úÖ **Complete all quality validations**

## Risk Assessment

### üü¢ Low Risk

- Inventory Service (92.88% - stable)
- Outbox Processor (94.04% - stable)

### üî¥ High Risk

- Queue Processors (33.9% - critical for async operations)
- Categories (15.54% - complex logic, low coverage)
